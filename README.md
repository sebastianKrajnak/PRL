# PRL odd-even merge sort
Project for parallel algorithms class focusing on the implementation of parallel odd-even merge sort algorithm, however due to the inconsistency in the class, it is simply hard coded special processor topology not Batcher's algo. 

## Requirements
* OpenMPI library
* C++ (gcc) 7.5.0

## Running the implementation
Runnin of the implementation is handled by test shell cript
```shell
./test.sh
```
